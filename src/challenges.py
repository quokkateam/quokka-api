It\'ll also help you manage stress and anxiety and reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity. Even our perceptions and mindsets on how physically active we are can predict health and longevity in the domains of stress, diet, and obesity.'

Depending on how intense the aerobic activity, you could take a brisk 30-min walk 5x a week or play a high-intensity sport for a shorter period. Adding in strength training twice a week can help with weight loss and increase your resting metabolic rate on top of all this!'

Sitting for prolonged periods throughout the day has been linked to heart disease and diabetes, and stepping away from the chair or even just standing for a few minutes every hour can help reduce these negative effects. Choosing to walk or bike, taking the stairs, and cleaning your room are easy ways to incorporate more physical activity in your day.'
